- Uploads of different post types; text or image.
- Text posts are stored in their own DB table. 

- Images should be encrypted, with the server having the decryption key. This prevents people from seeing the image with the image URL.

- Posts should have an optional title.
- Be able to view existing posts.
- Be able to share links to posts. Must be logged in to view.
- Be able to delete posts.

Next up:

1. Design home page.
2. Design logged-in page template. The dashboard should have buttons to upload text or images, and should show you a paginated list with thumbnails for your posts.
3. When viewing a post that belongs to you, should show option to delete the post, or edit the post (for text posts).
